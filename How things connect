How things connect in the system - what is the exact code, that lead you to connect from front to back to database?
GOAL: be good enough that you can just hack your way using AI and can debug well. Understanding> code / learning a language.
Internet is the product of a full stack.

[User Browser] - [Front End: React] - [API Call: via REST or GraphQL API HTTP request/ Websocket: real time] - [Back End] - [Database: sends back response usually JSON]
[Front End] HTML/CSS/JS, **React**, WWW
[API] REST or GraphQL. Via a network request. located by a url.
[Authentication] JWT, OAuth, or session-based authentication
[Deployment] Docker (running containers), Kubernetes (orchestrate and manage containers), cloud (**AWS**, GCP, Azure) can be serverless
[Back End] Node.js, Django
[Database] MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite - data storage designed for storing, retriving, managing data as associative, array, dictionaries, or hash table
- SQL Database (Relational Database): MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite
>> more structured, fixed schema, ACID compliance
>> Query language: SQL e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, Meta's XDB
- NoSQL (Non-relational database): 
>> key-value, document, graph-based
>> Query language: JSON based, MapReduce, custom APIs e.g. MongoDB(document), Meta's DocDB, TAO (key value), firecase
- **ORMs**: e.g. sequelize

What is a backend?
- HARDWARE you can connect via a hardware outside of your computer
- or CLOUD where you connect via browser
